## Description

### ðŸ“‹ HOW TO USE

1. Open a new tab (cannot be a blank tab)
2. Find Annoying Goose in your extensions list, then click it and select "Start Goose".

- To disable the goose select "VAPORIZE GOOSE" from the extension.
- To open a popup allowing you to manually change the goose's current activity, select "Enable State Swapper" from the extension.

### ðŸ“… VERSION HISTORY

=== Version 1.4 ===

- Made the goose block HTML elements it is currently on top of. This prevents the user from accidently clicking something else while trying to interact with the goose.
- Fixed a bug where the goose would occasionally glitch out after stepping out of mud.
- Made all music and sound effects pause when the user leaves the active tab.
- Added a "buy me a coffee" button to the main extension popup :)

=== Version 1.3 ===

- Fixed a bug where the mouse could be held down to hit the goose multiple times.

=== Version 1.2 ===

- Added toggle button to enable/disable the Goose State Swapper pop-up.

=== Version 1.1 ===

- Added the goose's "track mud" state.
- Added text boxes for the goose.
- Fixed movement bugs.

## Plans

- Add a settings button within popup specifying the "evilness level" of the goose.
  - The higher the evilness level, the more "crazy" the goose's pranks will be (i.e. ability to close tabs and other destructive actions).
