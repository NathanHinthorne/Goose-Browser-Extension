## Description

A pixel art goose that wanders around your screen and does random stuff. You could use it to prank your friends, or keep it around as a little browser buddy :D

### 📋 HOW TO USE

1. Open a new tab (cannot be a blank tab)
2. Find Annoying Goose in your extensions list, then click it and select "Start Goose".

- To disable the goose select "VAPORIZE GOOSE" from the extension.
- To open a popup allowing you to manually change the goose's current activity, select "Enable State Swapper" from the extension.

### 🎨 ARTWORK

- Credit to Sonicfan32 for the goose sprite sheet.
- Remaining sprites were created by me (Nathan)

## Plans

- New goose states:

- Volume slider in popup

- Minigame (will take a lot of time)
  - Whenever the goose is active, make a random chance golden goose eggs to appear randomly on the screen. When clicked, immediately enter the minigame, with circle closing inwards around the egg as a screen transition.
  
  - In the extension popup, make a grayed out button that says "Play Minigame" with a ticket icon. When clicked, use up a ticket and open a new tab with the minigame where the user controls a goose with arrows keys in (1) a platformer style game to collect coins/bills with a goose face on them or (2) a flappy bird style game to avoid obstacles (with a counter going up for each obstacle avoided). The coins/bills are the currency which will be used for clothing items for the goose.
