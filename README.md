### ðŸŽ¨ ARTWORK

- Credit to Sonicfan32 for the goose sprite sheet.
- Remaining sprites were created by me (Nathan)

## Plans

- Add a settings button within popup specifying the "evilness level" of the goose.
  - The higher the evilness level, the more "crazy" the goose's pranks will be (i.e. ability to close tabs and other destructive actions).
